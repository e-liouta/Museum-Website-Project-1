# Museum Website | Project-1
This is Project 1 for the Front End Programming Course | HCI Master | University of Patras

For this project I redisigned and developed the Archaeological Museum of Thessaloniki.

## The Design
For the UI Design I used figma. The design is available [here](https://www.figma.com/file/hXjDsVf25Vjy7TNS5JKYq8/Assigment-1-%2F-Font-End-Programming?node-id=1%3A2&t=YOvk0zZlQdtEu2Wf-1)
