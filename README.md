# Museum Website | Project-1
This is Project 1 for the Front End Programming Course | HCI Master | University of Patras

For this project I redisigned and developed the Archaeological Museum of Thessaloniki.

## The Design
For the UI Design I used figma. The design is available [here](https://www.figma.com/file/hXjDsVf25Vjy7TNS5JKYq8/Assigment-1-%2F-Font-End-Programming?node-id=1%3A2&t=YOvk0zZlQdtEu2Wf-1)

## Deployment
This project has been deployed on Netlify. You can view it live at [archaeological-museum.netlify.app](https://archaeological-museum.netlify.app)

## Technologies
This project was developed using three core web technologies: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. By using these three technologies together, this project was able to deliver a responsive and engaging user experience.

## Feautures
This project is a fully responsive website that features an archaelogical museum. The inspirations was the archaeological museum of Thessaloniki. The project consist of 5 main pages: Home, Events, Exhibitions, Reservations and Contact Page and child pages for each Event. The Home page contains a welcome message and a short description of what anyone can view in the site. The Event's page has list of upcoming events, and the Exhibitions's page a grid with the current exhibitions. The Reservation's page has a reservation form where users can reserve their spot. The Contact Page has a Map with the exact museum's location and more contact information as well.
